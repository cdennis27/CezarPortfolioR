        Hi, my name is Cezar Amaral.
        </p>
        <p>
        Since a early start, beginning my journey with computers and cars during the 90's, I have been managing automotive repair and manufacturing projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        From simple maintenance to custom hand-made restoration and fabrication.
      </p>
      <p>
        After working intermittently with software and hardware at work and as a hobby, I decided to transition to a full time software development career.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just finished a WebDev Fullstack Bootcamp at University of Toronto and now I see myself working with marketing campaigns, social media, small business work-flow applications and websites.
